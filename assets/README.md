2. **Medium Priority**: Hero screenshot and social sharing image
3. **Low Priority**: Story illustrations (can use placeholders initially)

## üõ†Ô∏è Asset Creation Tools

### Free Options

- **GIMP**: Full-featured image editor
- **Figma**: UI design and icon creation
- **Unsplash**: Free stock photos for backgrounds

### AI Generation
- **Midjourney**: High-quality artistic images
- **DALL-E**: Accessible AI image generation
- **Stable Diffusion**: Open-source AI art
- **Adobe Firefly**: AI with commercial licensing

### Quick Creation Script
```bash
# Create placeholder assets quickly
mkdir -p assets/images/stories/{solar-storm,geomagnetic-storm,cme}
mkdir -p assets/images/{icons,screenshots}
mkdir -p assets/audio/stories/{solar-storm,geomagnetic-storm,cme}

# Generate simple placeholder SVGs (can be converted to PNG)
# This would be a separate script to create minimal viable assets
```

The app is designed to work beautifully even with placeholder assets, but proper illustrations will significantly enhance the educational impact and demo appeal.
